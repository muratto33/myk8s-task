for troubleshooting pods below methods can be used:

1. get the list of all pods
   # kubectl get pods

2. get all detailed info about a pod in yaml format (we can send output to file and analyze)
# kubectl get pod pod_Name -o yaml  > analyze.txt
# vim analyze.txt

3. by getting description, we can see summary and try to find out the issue
# kubectl describe pod pod_Name
